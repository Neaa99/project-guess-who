# Project Name

Week 5 og the Technigo Bootcamp. This week I made a digital version of the boardgame Guess Who?
To make it more fun I decided to make a Game if Thrones edition!

## The problem

This week was hard, but learned a LOT! My major issue was filtering the characters. I leaned that all the datatypes in the character array needed to be the same for everything to work good. Also that filtering characters with and without an array looks diffrent.
